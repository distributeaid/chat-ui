This provides the UI for the in-app-chat as a standalone micro-frontend.

## Installation

Installation depends on the approach you are using, at minimum:

- include the _Chat UI Bundle_ attached to the
  [releases](https://github.com/distributeaid/chat-ui/releases)

Launch the chat:

```javascript
DAChat({
  context: "general", // identifies the context to open
  apiKey: "da2-XXX", // API key for the Twilio Integration API
  apiEndpoint: "https://xxx.appsync-api.yyy.amazonaws.com/graphql", // AppSync endpoint of the Twilio Integration API
  token: "" // JWT generated by your backend
});
```

[Here is the Toolbox example](https://gitlab.com/distribute-aid/toolbox/-/blob/master/assets/js/chat.js)
which has a feature flag and lazy loading.

## Configuration

Provide the integration API's settings in the environment variables:

    export GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT=https://xxx.appsync-api.yyy.amazonaws.com/graphql
    export GRAPHQL_API_KEY=xxx-yyy

## Development

Start the development server

    npm ci
    npm start

### Tokens

The chat expects a valid JWT which will be verified by the integration, follow
[the instructions here](https://github.com/distributeaid/twilio-integration#generating-keypairs)
to create a token.

## Lazy loading the Chat widget

The Chat UI provides a light-weight chat button which can be shown to the user
which only has a weight of 4KB (a loader for JS files and the chat icon), only
after the user clicks the button, the JavaScript for the entire chat widget will
be loaded. A cookie will remember whether the chat should be open.

The small chat button is only show if a localStorage setting is enabled:
`window.localStorage.setItem('DAChat:enabled', '1')`, this way we can test the
feature without needing a feature flag in the toolbox.

## UI and features

The chat window will open and you will be able to chat in the `#general` and the
`#random` channel.

### Error on first connect: `Failed to join channel "general"`
